            <h2>Air Fryer Salmon</h2>
            <p>For the fastest meal ever, turn to your air fryer. This salmon cooks in just 10 minutes and comes out perfectly tender on the inside with an amazing top crust. The sweet mustard topping makes this one of our favorite salmon dishes.</p>

            <h2>French Pizza Bread</h2>
            <p>Skip the homemade pizza dough and grab the nearest French bread. The loaf makes for a base that has a crispy outside with a soft inside. It's the best of both worlds and ours gets brushed with garlic butter to combine our two favorite things – garlic bread and pizza. Top the pizza with any of your favorite toppings. </p>
